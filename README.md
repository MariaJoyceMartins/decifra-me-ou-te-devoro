### About the project
Using the Python programming language, I created the logic for creating questions with personalized feedback. It was created after learning from a project in the "100 projects in 100 days" course by Dr. Angela Yu, in which I was on day 1, learning about strings.

I sought to challenge myself, so I added new complexities on my own, such as conditionals (else, else if and if) and loops (while true).

As I am a beginner, but really wanted to put the puzzle on the internet, I used "lovable" to create it for me, so all the code in typescript and css was AI.

### Explanation of why I used AI to create the website.

In the future, my goal is to create websites using Python to be able to get my projects online.

It is important to note that Python is my main programming language because I work with data, and I want to focus on data science and AI.

However, as I do not yet have the ability to create websites to get my professional and personal projects online, I used AI to make this dream come true. mainly because I'm passionate about puzzles

so, congratulations to AI for building the code and see the codes I created on my own during the course in the "100 projects in 100 days" repository
